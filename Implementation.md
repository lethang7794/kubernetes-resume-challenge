# KRC Implementation

## Step 1: Certification

To tackle this challenge effectively, challenger needs to have a solid understanding of Kubernetes concepts and practical experience - equivalent to passed a Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD).

Before this challenge,

- I've used K8s at work to develope Go web application & deploy containerized app to AWS EKS.
- I've read (& followed) 2 famous books about Kubernetes
  - Kubernetes: Up and Running: Dive into the Future of Infrastructure (3rd Edition)
  - Kubernetes in Action, Second Edition

But it's almost one year ago, so I'll

- follow KodeKloud Kubernetes Crash Course to regain my knowledge about K8s for this challenge
- take the CKDA certification later (in this year)
